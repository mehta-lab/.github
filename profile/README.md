[The Chan Zuckerberg Biohub San Francisco](https://czbiohub.org/sf) is a nonprofit research institute focused on understanding the underlying mechanisms of disease and on developing new technologies that will lead to actionable diagnostics and effective therapies. We are a regional research endeavor with international reach, where the San Francisco Bay Area’s leading academic institutions (Stanford University; University of California, Berkeley; and University California, San Francisco) join forces with CZ Biohub’s innovative internal team to catalyze impact, spurring partnerships that benefit people around the world. The tools and technologies we create will always be freely available to scientists everywhere.

This GitHub organization is home to the computational imaging and computer vision projects of the Computational Microscopy Platform at the CZ Biohub SF. We also maintain forks of related open-source projects and the code for reproducing our published work on this organization. Our projects on high throughput microscopy and next generation file format are maintained on the main [CZ Biohub org](https://github.com/czbiohub/).
